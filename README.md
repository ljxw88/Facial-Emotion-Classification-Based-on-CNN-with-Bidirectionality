## Hierarchical-CNN-with-Bidirectionality-on-FER
In this paper the framework of our method is explained, and the classification result is presented, compared, and analysed, the experiment result shows that the framework achieves good performance on SFEW benchmark. Further more, some future works for precision improvement based on existing the deficiency of current model are presented.
