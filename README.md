# Facial Emotion Classification Based on CNN with Bidirectionality

## Abstract
The SFEW database contains unconstrained facial expressions close to real world. In former research, current machine learning techniques are not robust enough for this uncontrolled environment. Based on the state-of-art model which achieved the best performance in SFEW, we proposed an augmentation method of adding bidirectionality to CNN based on Tomâ€™s bidirectional neural network prototype, which is the first to combine these two models in literature. We also conducted an experiment of applying decision fusion CNN framework on classifying by training the networks in parallel simultaneously forward and averaging their respective output. In this paper, two algorithms of adding bidirectionality to CNN are proposed, a framework of FER module(ensemble of HOG face detector and CNN with decision fusion and bidirectionality) is introduced and the classification result is listed, compared, and analysed. The final experiment results affirmed that the bidirectional boosting achieves good performance on SFEW benchmark. Furthermore, some future works for precision improvement based on the existing deficiency of current model are presented.
